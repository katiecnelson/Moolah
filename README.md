Moolah is a cross platform iOS/Android budgeting app based on the principles of percentage-based budgeting.
The most famous version of this budgeting style is the 50/30/20 budget, but any percentages can be used!
Moolah was made with love in Javascript and React Native (Expo) using an SQLite database.

See the Moolah User Guide for installation instructions and some additional useful information.
